# Business Application Programming

A collection of exercises completed for a university course on business application programming using **Groovy 4** on the JVM.

## About

The course covers practical programming skills relevant to business software development - from functional programming and data processing to GUI applications and external API integration. All exercises are written in Groovy, leveraging its concise syntax and Java interoperability.

## Topics Covered

- **Functional programming** - closures, higher-order functions, memoization, trampoline recursion
- **Collections & data transformations** - list/map operations, grouping, sorting with custom comparators, set operations
- **String & text processing** - regex, locale-aware sorting, anagram detection, Polish language support
- **File I/O** - reading and parsing structured files (TSV, text), JSON serialization, directory traversal
- **External APIs** - consuming REST APIs (e.g. NBP currency exchange rates), JSON parsing
- **GUI development** - building desktop applications with Swing and Groovy's SwingBuilder DSL
- **Algorithms** - Fibonacci with trampoline optimization, number-to-words conversion, data aggregation
